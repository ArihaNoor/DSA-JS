// What is Time Complexity?
// Time Complexity is not equal to the Time taken to run a program 
//Time complexity is defined as the rate at which time taken increases with respect to the input size.
//----Big O() Notation---

//Rules for Optimization
// 1- Avoid Constants 
// like if we have a O(Nx3 + 1) Here 1 is constant value which do not have any effect on the time complexity so we will not consider it.
// 2- Always compute time complexity considering worst case scnerio
// 3- Avoid Lower Values -- like don't consider exponential values which are very smaller and have no signifcance.
 
// There are 3 cases: Best case, Worst Case and Average Case
