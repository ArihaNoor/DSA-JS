// What is Time Complexity?
// Time Complexity is not equal to the Time taken to run a program 
//Time complexity is defined as the rate at which time taken increases with respect to the input size.
//----Big O() Notation---

//Rules for Optimization
// 1- Avoid Constants 
// like if we have a O(Nx3 + 1) Here 1 is constant value which do not have any effect on the time complexity so we will not consider it.
// 2- Always compute time complexity considering worst case scnerio
// 3- Avoid Lower Values -- like don't consider exponential values which are very smaller and have no signifcance.
 
// There are 3 cases: Best case, Worst Case and Average Case

//---Space Complexity---
//Memory space a program can take
// There are two space types involved:
// 1- Input Space : That you take to store the problem 
// 2- Auxiliary Space: that you take to solve the problem 

// If I am storing N size of array this means that we are using O(N) space complexity.
